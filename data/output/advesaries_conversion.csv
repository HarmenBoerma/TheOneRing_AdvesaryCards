There they hide, when they don’t prowl the land with war-bands led by warriors of the Hill-men of Rhudaur, who profit from the Goblins’ abilities as scouts and look-outs. The Goblins both hate and fear those who defeated their master, the Dúnedain and the High Elves of Rivendell.","Vicious, Stealthy",front,,,,,,,,

Many of these took refuge in the White Mountains, becoming a plague on the lands of the Mark until the last of them were finally hunted down and slain by Folca King in 2863.

Known also as Man-orcs, they are tall and ferocious, and are often dispatched to assault enemies defending behind an advantageous position, like a shield-wall formation for example, as their reach is longer than that of most Orcs.","Tall, Ferocious",front,,,,,,,,
./images/template/card_layout_front.png,Uruk-Hai Soldiers,./images/advesaries/uruk-hai_soldiers.png,6,"Large and heavily muscled with fearsome features, many of these slant-eyed Orcs serve Saruman the White. They are equipped in Isengard, and are clad in heavy iron mail and wield broad short swords. But the Uruk-hai are not crude and savage as other Orcs.

They are keen-minded and brutally efficient, driving their ‘lads’ with a combination of cracking whips and promised pain for those who do not follow their orders. Those serving Saruman are unwaveringly loyal to the White Hand and are often the only Orcs in a given company who have any hint at the reasons behind a mysterious command from their master.","Cunning, Fierce",front,,,,,,,,
./images/template/card_layout_front.png,Goblin-Men,./images/advesaries/goblin-men.png,3,"Not obviously as Orc-like as the Half-orcs, Goblin-men are able to pass as individuals of a particularly foul appearance and temperament.

They are tall and gaunt, with long limbs and flat, almost noseless faces. Only a few members of that fell race survive today, in dark caverns beneath the Grey Mountains and under the Mountains of Mirkwood.

The most dangerous among them are said to have once lived in the marshes to the east of Mirkwood. No one has seen an Ogre in recent times, and the old and wise among the Men of the Lake say that they retreated among the mists of the bogs when Smaug took residence under the Lonely Mountain - few monsters were a match for a great Dragon! But now Smaug is dead, and the Marsh-ogres could emerge once again from their stinking retreats to threaten Lake-town and its prospering inhabitants.","Slimy, Vicious",front,,,,,,,,
./images/template/card_layout_front.png,Fungal Troll,./images/advesaries/fungal_troll.png,10,"Cave-Trolls that linger too long in the depths of Nan Mordeleb can change nearly beyond recognition, their bodies becoming hosts to swarms of fungal infestations.

They are gigantic in size, sometimes as big as horses or greater, but their soft, flexible bodies enable them to hide in surprisingly narrow passages. While they can always be described as monstrous spider creatures, their features often differ from one individual to another: the number and appearance of their legs and eyes may vary, for instance — some are supported by long and thin stalks, others move about on strong and hairy limbs ending in claw-like appendages, some spy from the dark with clustered eyes, and others follow their prey with bulbous, many-windowed eyes. Regardless of the details, Great Spiders are always a terrifying sight.","Vicious, Fierce",front,,,,,,,,

These Vampires belong to an astute and patient breed, always aware of the will of their Master and ready to do his bidding.
