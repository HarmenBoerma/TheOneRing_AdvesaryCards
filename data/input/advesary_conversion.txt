A small, vicious breed of Orcs still inhabit the ruins of Carn Dûm. There they hide, when they don’t prowl the land with war-bands led by warriors of the Hill-men of Rhudaur, who profit from the Goblins’ abilities as scouts and look-outs. The Goblins both hate and fear those who defeated their master, the Dúnedain and the High Elves of Rivendell.

Orcs of the White Mountains
After their defeat in the Battle of Azanulbizar, countless Orcs fled south from the Misty Mountains. Many of these took refuge in the White Mountains, becoming a plague on the lands of the Mark until the last of them were finally hunted down and slain by Folca King in 2863. Yet in some hidden fortresses within the least accessible corners of the White Mountains Orcs remain, lean and hungry and kept warm against the cold by the hate burning within their breasts.

The more ill-favoured of Saruman’s creations are the Half-orcs, creatures whose ancestry cannot be disguised. Known also as Man-orcs, they are tall and ferocious, and are often dispatched to assault enemies defending behind an advantageous position, like a shield-wall formation for example, as their reach is longer than that of most Orcs.

They are keen-minded and brutally efficient, driving their ‘lads’ with a combination of cracking whips and promised pain for those who do not follow their orders. Those serving Saruman are unwaveringly loyal to the White Hand and are often the only Orcs in a given company who have any hint at the reasons behind a mysterious command from their master.

Not obviously as Orc-like as the Half-orcs, Goblin-men are able to pass as individuals of a particularly foul appearance and temperament. They often work as spies and emissaries for their master in Orthanc, due to their ability to pass relatively unnoticed in civilised lands. From Bree to Gondor, they skulk in the shadows and listen to idle talk across Middle-earth before returning to Isengard.

Hobgoblins are an especially malevolent race of Orcs bred in the North in ages past. They are tall and gaunt, with long limbs and flat, almost noseless faces. Only a few members of that fell race survive today, in dark caverns beneath the Grey Mountains and under the Mountains of Mirkwood. Like the smaller Goblins of the mountains, they hate the light of the sun and rarely venture far from their lairs, but are exceedingly powerful at night or when prowling in darkness

Some of the more terrifying tales surviving in the North talk of
horrible man-eating Giants who were said to prowl lonely
moors and bogs in search of prey. The most dangerous among
them are said to have once lived in the marshes to the east of
Mirkwood. No one has seen an Ogre in recent times, and the
old and wise among the Men of the Lake say that they
retreated among the mists of the bogs when Smaug took
residence under the Lonely Mountain - few monsters were a
match for a great Dragon! But now Smaug is dead, and the
Marsh-ogres could emerge once again from their stinking

Great Spider
Great Spiders display their dreadful heritage much more prominently
than the lesser Attercops. They are gigantic in size,
sometimes as big as horses or greater, but their soft, flexible
bodies enable them to hide in surprisingly narrow passages.
While they can always be described as monstrous spider creatures,
their features often differ from one individual to another:
the number and appearance of their legs and eyes may vary,
for instance — some are supported by long and thin stalks, others
move about on strong and hairy limbs ending in claw-like
appendages, some spy from the dark with clustered eyes, and
others follow their prey with bulbous, many-windowed eyes.
Regardless of the details, Great Spiders are always a terrifying

Spectres
Not all the spirits that tarry in Middle-earth are bound to the
service of Sauron, yet all feel the pull of his will. Powerful and

passion and great pride are often so consumed by their
obsessions that they can linger on after death, haunting places
they once used to love or inhabit.

Grim Hawks
Grim Hawks eat fish and smaller birds, as well as the worms and
other insects that they dig out of the mud with their wickedly
sharp curved beaks. They also eat carrion by placing one
clawed foot on the corpse and tearing the flesh with their
beaks. A hungry Grim Hawk can be brave enough to attack an
armed man (and a flock may surround a group of men). The
River-folk hunt Grim Hawks using arrows and stones; the birds
taste terrible, but their beaks and claws are prized as
decorations.
